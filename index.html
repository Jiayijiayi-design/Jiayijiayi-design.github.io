<p>Luckily we are here to help Berit. We have analysed two datasets:  NYC Citywide Annualized Calendar Sales Update and NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date), both  from NYC OpenData.<br />
On top of that, we have gathered Geographical data to visualize maps for better overview.

<p>First we take a look at just the house sale prices in the period of 2018-2019 in the entire NYC.
The distribution of prices are mostly aggregated in the left side of the figure, where 90 % of the house sale prices in NY cost under 2 million dollars. In other words, If Berit has 2 million dollars, she will have 90% chance of getting a house in NYC.</p>

<p>If Berit wants to increase her chance or has financial limitations, she will have to limit her search area to more specific boroughs. Here you will find that Queens (97,63%) Richmond/Staten Island (99,35%) and Bronx has ( 95.49% ) of their house prices under 2 million. Whereas In Manhattan the chance is  74.12% and Brooklyn is 89.94%
In other words, your chances of getting a house under 2 million increases if you’re looking in Queens Richmond/Staten Island or Bronx.</p>

<p>First we see if it is equally safe to live over all the precincts. We assume that the amount of arrest is a good indication for the safety in the areas.
Berit does not know where precinct lies or which borough that is. So to help her we have made a interactive map that shows the the number of arrest in each precinct and what borough that belongs to if you hover the mouse above.<br />
There are some areas that are safer to live than others.</p>

<p>Apparently does the police tag the races of who commits the crime. Black is clearly the races with highest arrest number, it stands for 47.8 % of the total arrest. The next races is white hispanic which are 25.2 % of all the arrests.
If we look closer to each borough then are the races represented differently.
For Berit race does not matter but it is an interesting that police register this.</p>

<p>To get a more visual perspective, we give a map of the distribution of the relevant crime types, which when compared to the house price map shows that the two are basically opposite trends, with high house prices and low crime numbers in Manhattan and low house prices and high crime numbers in the Bronx.
Thus, for random crimes such as robberies and assaults, choosing areas with high house prices can be avoided to some extent.</p>

<p>In order to give Berit an overview of possibilities and if the crime is related to the housing prices. We tried to gather the interesting information into one data set and applied unsupervised learning
This means we took at a part of the data from the arrest and house sale dataset and gathered it into one.
In the arrest data only the three crimes types &lsquo;assault 3 related offence, robbery and felony assault is used as they affected the housing prices. The dataset is merged based on the longitudes and latitudes of the arrest and house sale as it is the most precise of the areas.
This big data set we then tried to split into 6 different groups based on their features. The data in each group should then have some similar traits for example the price range or where it happens.</p>

<p>If you look at the brown boxplot to the left, it shows the price range of group 5 and the plot to the left shows gross square feet of the sale. This brown boxplot lies generally a bit higher than the others but still in the same range. So even though Berit is paying more for the apartment does it not necessarily means that she gets more space according to our analysis.  It shows that even through the sales prices differs a lot then the square feets span over a wide range.</p>

<p>Now we look at groups with the lowest prices (group 3 in red) and with the highest prices (group 5 in brown). The bar chart shows that the expensive group has a higher risk of robbery where the Assault 3 and related offenses is lower than cheaper group. But as there is not a great difference between the two group  it is difficult to conclude anything. There we should maybe have included more offense types.</p>
